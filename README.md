# 🚀 EF Core Demo with Strongly Typed IDs, Value Objects, and Smart Enums

This repository demonstrates an implementation of **Strongly Typed IDs**, **Value Objects**, **Smart Enums**, and **EF Core Migrations** in C#. It showcases how to build a rich domain model that ensures type safety, encapsulates business logic, and works seamlessly with EF Core for persistence.

## This implementation includes:

- ✅ **Strongly Typed IDs**: Custom ID types like `GuestId`, `NationalityId`, ensuring type safety and better expressiveness.
- ✅ **Value Objects**: Immutable objects that encapsulate domain logic, such as `PersonName`, `EmailAddress`, and `SimpleAddress`.
- ✅ **Smart Enums**: Enums with behavior and logic, like `GuestType`, which encapsulate specific domain-related functionality.
- ✅ **EF Core Migrations**: How to configure EF Core to properly persist these types in a relational database.

## Features

- 🔗 **Rich Domain Model**: Supports complex business logic with strongly typed IDs, value objects, and smart enums.
- ⚡ **Fluent Configuration**: Easy-to-use EF Core configuration to handle these types.
- 🛠️ **EF Core Migrations**: Handles migrations and schema updates for strongly typed IDs and value objects.
- 🛡️ **Type Safety**: Strongly typed IDs and value objects improve safety and readability of your domain models.
- 🧑‍💻 **Demo Project**: Includes example implementations for handling `Guest` entities and more.
